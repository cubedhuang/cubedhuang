# Daniel 👋! <img src="https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=cubedhuang&color=15171a">

Hi! I'm **Daniel** (he/they), a 16-year-old developer from the United States.

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?theme=dark&i=ts,js,html,css,rust,vscode,tailwind,github,nextjs,react,mongodb,nodejs)](https://skillicons.dev)

## My Projects ✨

- [🌎 My Personal Website](https://dan.onl), made with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. It includes a breakdown of my top Spotify tracks!
- [🖥️ College Board Pseudocode Interpreter](https://board.dan.onl), an interpreter for the pseudocode language College Board specifies on the AP Computer Science Principles Exam reference sheet. It includes a breakdown of tokens processed and a collapsible abstract syntax tree to explore.
- [🛠️ Slate - Discord Bot](https://slate.dan.onl), a general-purpose utility Discord bot with features like math solving, moderation, and voice channel activities. It's still closed source because I used to have a bunch of tokens and stuff laying around in the source code and I'm in the middle of a rewrite to support interactions. But it still works!
- [🧪 CubeDHuang: Web Experiments](https://cubedhuang.com), a lot of old games and stuff I tried making in middle school. There are also some more recent experiments I threw together like a Wordle result narrower on the more experiments page.
- [🕊️ Boids](https://boids.cubedhuang.com), a flocking simulation with tons of different parameters to mess around with. It uses PixiJS for rendering and is optimized with a spatial subdivision system. Inspired by the Coding Train's flocking simulation coding challenge.
