## My Projects ‚ú®

- [üåé My Personal Website](https://dan.onl), made with Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. It includes a breakdown of my top Spotify tracks!
- [üìñ nimi.li](https://nimi.li), an interactive toki pona dictionary which uses nimi Linku and jan Sonja's compiled compounds list.
- [üñ•Ô∏è College Board Pseudocode Interpreter](https://board.dan.onl), an interpreter for the pseudocode language College Board specifies on the AP Computer Science Principles Exam reference sheet. It includes a breakdown of tokens processed and a collapsible abstract syntax tree to explore.
- [üõ†Ô∏è Slate - Discord Bot](https://slate.dan.onl), a general-purpose utility Discord bot with features like math solving, moderation, and voice channel activities. It's still closed source because I used to have a bunch of tokens and stuff laying around in the source code and I'm in the middle of a rewrite to support interactions. But it still works!
- [üìì Discord Embed Creator](https://embed.dan.onl), a tool that lets you create, share, and generate discord.js and discord.py code to send message embeds.
- [üïäÔ∏è Boids](https://boids.cubedhuang.com), a flocking simulation with tons of different parameters to mess around with. It uses PixiJS for rendering and is optimized with a spatial subdivision system. Inspired by the Coding Train's flocking simulation coding challenge.
- [üü© Wordle Bot](https://github.com/cubedhuang/wordle-bot), a simple Discord bot which uses image rendering to play games, showing the game keyboard to be as accurate to the original site as possible.
- [üß™ CubeDHuang: Web Experiments](https://cubedhuang.com), a lot of old games and stuff I tried making in middle school. There are also some more recent experiments I threw together like a Wordle result narrower on the more experiments page.

## The Rust vs. YAML Debate

| Feature               | Rust                                                              | YAML                                                                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose               | Systems programming language                                      | Human-readable data serialization format                            |
| Syntax                | Similar to C++, easy-to-read                                      | Highly-readable with minimal structure                              |
| Performance           | High-performance without runtime overhead, memory-safe            | Relatively slower, processing overhead                              |
| Learning Curve        | Steep, especially ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes concepts    | Faster, simple syntax and structure                                 |
| Concurrency           | Excellent support for concurrent programming                      | Not applicable, as YAML is a data format                            |
| Ecosystem             | Growing community with extensive libraries and documentation      | Language-agnostic, available for various programming languages      |
| Error and Type Safety | Emphasis on safety and correctness, strongly-typed                | Lacks strong typing, error-prone due to whitespace sensitivity      |
| Use Cases             | Systems programming, embedded systems, high-performance systems   | Configuration files, data exchange, management of complex data      |
| Interoperability      | C-compatible, easy interaction with existing C libraries          | Versatile, integration with multiple programming languages          |
| Security              | Safer due to memory-safety guarantees and no garbage collection   | Security vulnerabilities with certain parsers, user-provided data   |
